# Consumer

- Apps or systems that consume data from Kafka Cluster. They subscribe to topics, process and receive messages.
- Can be implemented in various languages and consume messages asynchronously or synchronously.
- Have configurations of consume behavior such as offset control, automatic commit and sizing capabilities to deal with large volumes of messages.
- Facilitates the implementation of distributed systems and real-time data processing.
- An offset only can be consumed by one consumer at a time.
- Commit: when the consumer is done processing a message, it indicates that to the Kafka Cluster. Can be auto-commit.

# Configurations

- `group.id`: The consumer group id.
- `bootstrap.servers`: The bootstrap servers to connect to. Ex: `localhost:9092`
- `auto.offset.reset`: The offset to start consuming from. Ex: `earliest`
- `enable.auto.commit`: The consumer can commit offsets automatically. Ex: `true`
